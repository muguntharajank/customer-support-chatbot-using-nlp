#🤖 Chatbot AI using E-Commerce Data
This project builds a basic AI-powered chatbot trained on real-world e-commerce order data. The chatbot can answer user queries related to orders, shipping, payments, and products using intent classification and machine learning.

#📌 Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Preprocess and merge datasets from an e-commerce platform.

Clean and prepare queries from structured fields like product categories.

Train an intent classification model using either Logistic Regression or a simple Deep Learning model.

Enable the chatbot to respond to user inputs based on learned intents.

#📁 Dataset Used
The chatbot is trained on merged data from the Olist E-Commerce Dataset:

olist_orders_dataset.csv – Customer order metadata.

olist_order_items_dataset.csv – Products within each order.

olist_order_payments_dataset.csv – Payment details.

olist_products_dataset.csv – Product metadata (including category names).

These are merged to simulate question-answer pairs and chatbot queries.

#🧠 Workflow
1. Library Import
Essential ML and deep learning libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas.

2. Dataset Loading
Load multiple CSV files and preview them to ensure correctness.

3. Merging & Cleaning
Join the datasets based on order_id and product_id.

Clean product categories or text fields using .lower() and .strip().

4. Text Vectorization
Use TfidfVectorizer to transform cleaned text into numerical features.

5. Label Encoding
Use LabelEncoder to encode categorical labels for training.

6. Model Training
Option A: Train a LogisticRegression model from Scikit-learn.

Option B: Train a simple TensorFlow Sequential model with Dense layers.

7. Prediction & Accuracy
Evaluate the model using accuracy_score.

Check performance on test set.

8. Chatbot Function
Take user input, transform it using TF-IDF.

Predict intent and respond accordingly.

#💬 Sample Code Snippet
python

Edit
def get_response(user_input):
    cleaned = clean_text(user_input)
    vector = vectorizer.transform([cleaned])
    pred = model.predict(vector)
    return label_encoder.inverse_transform(pred)[0]
#✅ Model Evaluation
Accuracy printed after training.

Supports both traditional ML and neural network classifiers.

Use either train_test_split or manual test queries.

#📌 Notes
The chatbot logic is built primarily for educational and demo purposes.

Performance depends heavily on how you structure and label training queries.
